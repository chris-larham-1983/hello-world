# hello-world
My first GitHub repository

My name is Chris and I am slowly making my way through the tutorial, getting to know how GitHub works.  I am interested in web development (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP) and mobile app development (PhoneGap).  One day in the not-too-distant future I will make use of three repositories, each storing assets for mobile phone applications.
